!!! info "Dolby Vision is available in several profiles"

    - **Profile 5** <sup>(*1*)</sup> - This is what comes with WEB-DL Dolby Vision release without HDR10 fallback.<br>(*Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens*)
    - **Profile 7** <sup>(*2*)</sup> - This is what comes with UHD Bluray Remuxes and UHD BluRay releases.<br>*These files will play on an Nvidia Shield Pro (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback.*
    - **Profile 8** <sup>(*3*)</sup> - This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL releases (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux and UHD BluRay releases all of which have HDR10 fallback.<br>*This works with several mainstream media players.*<br>
    ------
    - <sup>(*1*) *On an AppleTV, these do not reliably play with the Plex app but will work better with the third-party Infuse app. MP4 files tend to work better than MKV files, obviously MKV is preferable because of its support for lossless audio.*<br>**It has been confirmed that with the latest beta build of Plex, Profile 5 MKV files now play correctly ! on an AppleTV 4K 1st gen, files are direct streamed (not transcoded) to an MP4 container and play using the native AVPlayer instead of Plexâ€™s MPV.**</sup>
    - <sup>(*2*) *Neither Infuse nor PLEX for AppleTV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7/8.*</sup>
    - <sup>(*3*) *Neither Infuse nor PLEX for AppleTV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7/8, And will only play the HDR10 fallback.* (*although your TV will incorrectly say that it is playing DV*)</sup>
