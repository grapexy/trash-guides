    *Possible Variables*

    **When no (U)HD BHDStudio or (U)HD WEBDL exist (or limited sources) it will grab the following:**

    - Get other HD Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized)
    - Prefer HQ Encodes (Bluray-720/1080)
    - When the IMAX-E is released it will upgrade to the IMAX-E.
    - When there is no BHDStudio release or WEBDL it will get a HD Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized)

    !!! info "BHDStudio"
        BHDStudio does HQ 1080p/2160p Encodes with the following features

        - Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
        - [1080p] AC3 Audio (Downmixed Lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility)
        - [2160p] Encoded lossless audio track to Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 with Dolby Digital 5.1 fallback.
        - [2160p] Dolby Vision with HDR10 fallback.
        - Small sizes
        - Good quality

        Biggest drawback if you don't have access to the top tier indexers you won't have access to all BHDStudio releases, and in that case you might need to choose a few of the optional variables.
