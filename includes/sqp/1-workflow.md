??? abstract "Workflow Logic - [CLICK TO EXPAND]"

    **Depending what's released first and available the following Workflow Logic will be used:**

    - When a HD WEBDL is released it will download the HD WEB-DL. (streaming services)
    - When a BHDStudio is released it will download the BHDStudio releases.
    - If no BHDStudio can be found (not existing or limited sources) it will prefer HQ WEB-DL.

    ------

    *Possible Variables*

    **When no BHDStudio or HD WEBDL exist (or limited sources) it will grab the following:**

    - Get other Bluray Encodes (less or not streaming optimized)
    - Prefer HQ Encodes (Bluray-720/1080)
    - When the IMAX-E is released it will upgrade to the IMAX-E.
    - When there is no BHDStudio release or WEBDL it will get a HQ Encode

    !!! info "BHDStudio"
        BHDStudio does HQ 1080p Encodes with the following features

        - Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
        - AC3 Audio (Downmixed Lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility)
        - Small sizes
        - Good quality
        - No Dolby Vision

        Biggest drawback if you don't have access to the top tier indexers you won't have access to all BHDStudio releases, and in that case you might need to choose a few of the optional variables.
